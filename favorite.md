  After completing the manipulating text assignment I started to think about which text editor is the
best choice for me. All three are powerful editors, but if I had to choose one, I would probably 
select nano for its ease of use and how intuitive it is.
  
  I found that using the control menu items to be fairly simple and was able to complete my work fairly
efficiently. I did have some difficulty with finding a number of matches for strings using nano. I 
searched extensively for ways of counting how many times a string appeared within the text , but 
couldn't really find a method similar to vi's (:%s/string/ng) or emacs (m-x count-matches) functions.
I resorted to using find (Kuno) and replace (Kuno) which provided me with a number of replacements 
or how many times the string appeared in the text. Not exactly sure if that was the best practice but
I ran out of options and tried being creative with how to come up with the answer. 

  I actually really enjoyed using emacs almst as much as nano. It relies on using the Control functions 
in  similar way as Nano and seems to have even more available functionality and added features than nano.
I found the menu items easy to navigate and use. I could definitely see myself using it more frequently
in the future.
  
  Vi seemed to be the most powerful text editor in terms of functinality, but I found that using the 
escape : function keys to  be counter-intuitive. It does have a huge list of functions but found that 
having to memorize them instead of having the menu items available to view, to be a bit cumbersome. I think 
that vi is an advanced version of the current availabel text editors. Once I become ery familiar with nano
and emacs, I could definitely see myself using Vi more frequently because of the many available functions and options.
